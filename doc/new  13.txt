# a2 - what is it all about
# bare a2 does nothing. Its a tool to manage and develop small to big helpers
that aim to make your day to day work at a windows pc more easy and fun.

# Its all Autohotkey. Itself its an incredible powerful scripting language that
enables you to set up hotkeys and shortcuts, manage loads of files, handle
program windows or modify text with a couple of lines code.
But if you work with it a little longer you have lots of single scripts flying
around and getting hold of it all gets cumbersome.
That calls for an Autohotkey-framework!

ac'tivAid was such a framework! It had lots of powerful tools in a simple
interface. Could be expanded arbitrarily and also provided the posibility
to setup almost anything yourself with a user hotkey.
Sadly ac'tivAids developer retired from it and then never evolved much further.
As it opened lots of doors on the one hand it had quite some shortcomings on the other.

a2 now aims to gather all the ideas and demands that arose into a nice and tiny
package to please everyones scripting needs.
It will give you a better overview of whats running, whats posible, whats
available and also open doors to create scripts yourself with the power and
performance of a grown framework.
